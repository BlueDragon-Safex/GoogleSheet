# GoogleSheet
This will hold examples on how to interact with the Safex.org Blockchain using Google Sheets &amp; Apps Script

Gogole Sheets is another way to interact with the Safex Blockchain. 
Where Google Sheets lives in the cloud, it has some things it can do more efficiently than a desktop tool, however, it does not come without its shortcomings either. 
Google sheets can be expanded by adding in Apps Script (Javascript) code that can do some more advanced and custom things. 

Here is an example that links to the blockchain:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JEJ3pdy4cM9ulqBVK2eJKowNtWNCLEy5uNLnYkG2waw/edit?usp=sharing
You can make a copy of it. 
You will also nee dot ensure you have some Apps Script in it. (In your own copy of the GSheet, click "Extensions" in the menu along top, then click "Apps Script"

This uses the "ImportJSON" script from https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON 
This also uses some custom functions (in this repository)
